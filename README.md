# terraform_testing
A repo to demonstrate testing within Terraform. Within this page we will look at several classifications of testing.
While some of these definitions may be disputed, it is important to take the value from each of the sections. 
By doing so, you can be more confident in your code/infrastructure.

Within this document I aim to quickly outline some different forms of testing your Terraform code:
- Static testing/ analyses 
- Linters
- Security testing
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Property testing
- E2E Testing
